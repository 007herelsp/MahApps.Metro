##Resources

**Starting with MahApps.Metro 0.7, there will *no longer* be any embedded icons**. These have all been moved to a separate nuget package that installs the fonts/XAML resources as loose files. This allows better discoverability and customisation.

You can install this package using nuget:

`PM> Install MahApps.Metro.Resources`
