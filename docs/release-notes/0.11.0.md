# Notes

**Warning**: This release has a few breaking changes. 
A quick overview:

- 'Colours' -> 'Colors'
  For consistency, we've chosen to rename all occurendes of 'Colours' to 'Colors'
- The 'TransitioningContentControl' use now an enumeration for 'Transition'

More details here: https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/wiki/Breaking-Changes-or-WTF-is-happening-with-the-ALPHA-version

Other things:

- You can now put all the resource dictionaries in your 'App.xaml' file
- ProgressIndicator is marked as 'Obsolete'. In future, use 'MetroProgressbar' with 'Indeterminate' set to 'true'
- Like the ProgressIndicator, the Panorama will be removed in future versions. 
  There is a chance that it will be rewritten and reintroduced later on.
- TextBox, PasswordBox, ComboBox and DatePicker use now the Validation.ErrorTemplate for displaying errors. 
  The default template is ValidationErrorTemplate.
