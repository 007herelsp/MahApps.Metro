# Features

## Dialog system

The dialog system has been overhauled for better extensibility.

The `SimpleDialog` class now allows to create a custom dialog.

`ProgressDialog` is a dialog that displays progress (duh!) inspired by Github for Windows.

For reference, see PR #[785](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/pull/785)

## Modal Flyouts

Just like modal dialogs, Flyouts can now be made modal by setting the `IsModal = true`.
