# Notes

This is a bug fix and minor fetaure release of MahApps.Metro.

# Features

- It's now possible to get an opened dialog from a MetroWindow #1739
- Allow the user to disable the window dragging #1669
- Dialogs can now use the ColorScheme = MetroDialogColorScheme.Inverted
- Add `MouseOverGlowEnabled` to `FlipView`
- Back/Forwad Buttons now enabled/disabled instead visible/or not
- `AreAnimationsEnabled` property for `Flyout` to show the `Flyout` directly or with animation
- `MaximumBodyHeight` for `MetroDialogSettings`, so we can get a `ScrollViewer` for long, very log text dingens...

# Bugfixes

- Fixed maximize button path only displays partially when using SaveWindowPosition #1580 #1693
- Fixed background of ComboBox #1713
