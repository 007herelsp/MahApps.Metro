The `MahApps.Metro` `ProgressBar` is like the built-in progress bar but, of course, restyled.

The upper two bars are the `ProgressBar` with different progress states. The third bar has `IsIndeterminate` set to `True`

# MetroProgressBar

`MetroProgressBar` is an alternative and simpler style. Instead of creating a normal `ProgressBar` use:

<Controls:MetroProgressBar />

The indeterminate state looks like a `ProgressRing` but not circular.
